# PaddTrekJs

PaddTrekJs is an HTML / JavaScript version of the classic mini-computer game. Specifically its a direct conversion of the iPad game [Padd Trek](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/padd-trek/id412782761?mt=8).

Currently very much a work in progress. Most testing is occurring in Firefox 4 due to the handiness of FireBug with occasional forays into Chrome and Safari.

To run it simply clone / download the repository and double click index.html. There are no server dependencies. Though right now there's not a lot to run.
